Installation
============

:mod:`metaseq` relies on the standard `Scientific Python Stack
<http://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html>`_, specifically, `NumPy
<http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/index.html>`_,
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_, and `pandas
<http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_. It also relies on standard genomics tools like
`BEDTools <http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_, `samtools
<http://samtools.sourceforge.net/>`_, and others.

Installing each of these prerequisites would be time-consuming and frustrating.
However `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html>`_ combined with the
`bioconda project <https://github.com/bioconda/recipes>`_ makes it easy and
straightforward.


Easy installation method
------------------------

The following assumes you have `conda
<http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html>`_ installed. `conda` is
a cross-platform package manager that started on Python but now includes other
languages and binaries as well.  There are two options for installing conda:
the `Anaconda Python distribution
<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_, which includes the full
scientific Python stack, or the smaller, barebones `Miniconda
<http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_.


The commands below work with either Linux or Mac OSX. See `managing
environments <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html>`_ to decide if you
want to use the main `conda` environment or an isoloated environment.

**Option 1:** Install the `metaseq` package and Python dependencies

.. code-block:: bash

    # install into main environment
    conda install --channel bioconda metaseq

    # ...or create a new isolated environment
    conda create -n my-env-name --channel bioconda metaseq

**Option 2:** Install the `metaseq` package and Python dependencies, plus BEDTools, samtools,
htslib, and the UCSC tools bigWigSummary, bedGraphToBigWig, bedToBigBed, and
bigBedToBed. This is a good option if you don't already maintain separate
installations of these tools

.. code-block:: bash

    # install into main environment
    conda install --channel bioconda metaseq-all

    # ...or create a new isolated environment
    conda create -n my-env-name --channel bioconda metaseq-all


.. _windows:

Windows
~~~~~~~
It is difficult to do bioinformatics work on Windows. The most convenient
option will be to run Ubuntu Linux on your Windows machine, and follow the
Linux instructions above to install metaseq and requirements.

Option 1: Dual boot Windows and Ubuntu
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
See instructions here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide.

:Advantages: You'll get the best performance

:Disadvantages: When you want to switch between Windows and Ubuntu you need to restart your computer

Option 2: Run Ubuntu on a virtual machine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
See instructions here: http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-38/.

:Advantages: You can start Ubuntu just like another program

:Disadvantages: Some additional complexity in setup, and performance won't be as good.
