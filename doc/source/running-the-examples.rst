Running the examples
--------------------
The examples use the `IPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ to
provide narrative descriptions along with executable code.

See `IPython Notebook Tutorials
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb>`_
to learn more about using the IPython Notebook.

#. Install metaseq and dependencies (see :ref:`installation`)
#. Make sure you are using the environment where metaseq is installed
#. Make sure you have the IPython Notebook::

    pip install ipython[all]

#. Download each example notebook as a file (right-click, save as):

   * `example 1 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daler/metaseq/master/doc/source/example_session.ipynb>`_

   * `example 2 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daler/metaseq/master/doc/source/example_session_2.ipynb>`_

#. In the directory where you saved the notebooks, run::

    ipython notebook


A browser window should pop up, and you can click on the example notebooks. See
the `IPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ page for more
information about the IPython Notebook in general.
